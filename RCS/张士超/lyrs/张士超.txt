昨天晚上 我走在回家路上
忽然想起 我没带钥匙
我打给你 二十六个电话(叮铃叮铃)
你没有接(你快点接) 你没有接
你回话了(喂干哈) 叫我等等(这会儿不方便) 你办完事就回家(真不行)
可是张士超 你这个混蛋！
你带著姑娘 去了闵行
你到底把我家钥匙放哪里了？
你到底把我家钥匙放哪里了？
你到底把我家钥匙放在哪里了？！

地毯找了 花园也找了(嘟噜嘟噜)
连门口大爷 我也都问过了
你就是忘了
你就是忘了
我们家在五角场
华师大的姑娘真的那么可爱吗？
华师大的姑娘真的那么可爱吗？
华师大的姑娘真的那么可爱吗？！

凛冽的风 冰冷的雨 国定路的落叶满地
我已经冻得不行 张大哥你在哪里
Sancta Maria Sancta Maria
让这个迷途的羔羊回家吧
钥匙啊钥匙 你快快出现

大不了我自己再去重新配一把
大不了我自己再去重新配一把
大不了我自己再去重新配一把
重新配一把
重新配一把
